## Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
The **Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization tool built to analyze and interpret patient survival trends based on age, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and lifestyle/health risk factors. Designed for healthcare analytics, it provides actionable insights to help medical professionals and researchers identify critical patterns and improve decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Survival Overview:** Displays overall survival rate (67.89%), average survival age (58.76 years), total survivals (203), and total deaths (96).
* **Age Group Insights:**
  * Survival counts vs. serum creatinine levels.
  * Survival counts vs. ejection fraction.
  * Survival rate trends by age group.
* **Risk Factor Impact:** Visualizes the influence of smoking, high blood pressure, anemia, and diabetes across different age groups.

## 📈 Insights
* Middle-aged groups (51–60) have the highest survival counts.
* Abnormal serum creatinine and low ejection fraction correlate with lower survival.
* Younger (<40) and older (>71) patients have significantly lower survival rates.
* Lifestyle and chronic conditions strongly affect patient outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization:** Power BI (primary), Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Dataset:** Structured medical heart disease dataset
